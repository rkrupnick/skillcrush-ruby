#Skillcrush 104


I have divided my work for this course into two folders: exercises and projects. [Exercises](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/exercises) are simple scripts 
written to play with a concept, while [Projects](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/projects) are useful command-line or Sinatra Apps.

Projects are more fun, so I list them first!

##Projects

1. [Always Three](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/projects/always_three_v.rb) This script takes
an integer input and does math magic to always end up with the number 3!
2. [Numerology Command Line](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/projects/numerology.rb) Input your birthday
and learn your numerology number and personality!
3. [Magic-8 Texting Ball](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/projects/magic.rb) Input a question and your
cell phone number and the app texs you the Magic-8-Ball Answer
4. [Command Line Weather App](https://github.com/rkrupnick/skillcrush-ruby/tree/master/projects/weather-app) Input your zip 
code and it returns th local weather for the next five days
